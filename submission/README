NOTE: 
=====

The files for the branched and the predicated implementations are - 
ADM-2021-A4-sort-branched-inplace.c
ADM-2021-A4-sort-predicated-inplace.c

To replicate the experiments described in the report, in the 'code' directory, compile the file using -
>gcc <filename>.c 

Run the resulting output file (ex: a.out) using -
>./a.out 1001214 l_orderkey-int32.csv

Note that the number and the file provided is to replicate the experiment recorded in the report

***

Alternatively in case the above doesn't work, the same files are also provided in the 'extras' directory, where the 'make' command can be run, followed by 
./ADM-2021-A4-sort-branched-inplace 1001214 l_orderkey-int32.csv
./ADM-2021-A4-sort-predicated-inplace 1001214 l_orderkey-int32.csv
